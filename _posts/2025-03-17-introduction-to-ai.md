## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI systems are designed to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## How Does AI Work?

AI works by processing large amounts of data using algorithms and statistical models. Two key subfields of AI are:

- **Machine Learning (ML):** Systems learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
- **Deep Learning (DL):** A subset of ML that uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data.

For example, AI can recognize faces in photos, recommend movies on streaming platforms, or even drive cars autonomously.

## Applications of AI

AI is transforming industries and everyday life. Here are some examples:

- **Healthcare:** AI helps diagnose diseases, recommend treatments, and analyze medical images.
- **Finance:** It detects fraudulent transactions and automates trading.
- **Autonomous Vehicles:** Self-driving cars use AI to navigate roads safely.
- **Customer Support:** AI-powered chatbots provide instant assistance to customers.
